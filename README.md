# CraftMyPlate - A Visually Stunning Flutter Application

Welcome to the repository for **CraftMyPlate**, a beautifully designed and highly functional Flutter application. This project showcases a sophisticated, animated user interface built with a clean, scalable architecture, focusing on delivering a premium user experience from the moment it launches.

## ‚≠ê An Experience Crafted with Animation & Style

This application is packed with modern UI patterns and fluid animations that make it a joy to use. Every interaction has been carefully designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.

### Glassmorphic Floating Navigation Bar
Navigate through the app with a stunning custom-built bottom navigation bar. It floats above the content with a beautiful frosted-glass effect, achieved using Flutter's `BackdropFilter`, providing a modern and elegant look.

### 3D Animated Sidebar Drawer
Access more options through an elegant sidebar that slides in from the right. When opened, it applies a dynamic scale, shift, and 3D perspective rotation to the main content, complemented by a smooth backdrop blur. This advanced animation creates a sense of depth and polish.

### Fluid Staggered Animations
The main dashboard comes to life with staggered animations on launch. Each widget, from the header to the menu cards, fades and slides into view sequentially. This delightful entrance effect is orchestrated with multiple `AnimationController` instances to ensure a smooth and engaging introduction to the app.

### Responsive & Adaptive Layout
The UI gracefully adapts to different screen sizes, with specific layouts optimized for **mobile**, **tablet** (`>600px`), and **large tablet** (`>900px`) devices. This ensures a consistent and high-quality experience on any device.
